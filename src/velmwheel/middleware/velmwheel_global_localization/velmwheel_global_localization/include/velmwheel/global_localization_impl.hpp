/**
 * @brief Class implementing set of algorithms utilized by the GlobalLocalization ROS node
 *    class based on one of two technics:
 * 
 *      * @b STD - a custom localization algorithm based on aproximated matching of 'local' and
 *                 'global' markers in the robot's environment
 *      * @b ICP - localization method based on the ICP algorithm finding transformation between
 *                 'local' and 'global' markers in the robot's environment
 * 
 * @note Comments of the GlobalLocalizationImpl implementation use two terms refering to specific
 *    FoR (Frames of Reference) - 'map' and 'odom'. These are not exactly names of concrete TF
 *    frames but rather representations of two concepts - reference frame of the markers present
 *    in the PoI map and reference frame of the odometry data. There is also reference to the 'robot'
 *    frame. This one refers to the concept of the locally-fixed frame in the robot's frame of reference

     * @brief Tries to match local-map markers with global-map markers based on set of features

     * @details For each local-map point to be matched function calculates vector of feature
     *    of other points in local map (aka 'neighbours'). Such a feature may be e.g. translation
     *    or distance between the given point and its' neighbour. Subsequently algorithm computes
     *    such features for each point in the global-map. To compute neighbour's feature the
     *    @p neighbour_feature callable is called with both - actual reference point and neighbout.
     * 
     *    For each global-map point, based on feature vectors algorithm tries to pair neighbours
     *    of the local- and global-map point in such a way that minimizes mean value of @p metric
     *    calculated on paired neighbours.
     *   
     *    Next, the overall cost of matching local- and global-map point is calculated as a mean
     *    metric calculated on paired neighbours. If such a metric is not greater than 
     *    @p mean_metric_limit the local point is matched.
     * 
     * @note In the original implementation by Wojtek Dudek there were four major differences to the
     *    described algorithm:
     *    
     *       1) Algorithm operated specifically on @p neighbour_feature being <b>distance</b> from the
     *          matched point to the neighbour and @p metric was <b>absolute difference</b> between
     *          features; this function provides a generalized approach to allow broader class of features
     * 
     *       2) Due to the 1) features vectors has been sorted (this is not possible in case of
     *          e.g. feature being a 2D translation between points); this has been exploited ( or at 
     *         least was intended to be, @see 3) ) in such a way that when algorithm has been iterating
     *         through vector of global-neighbours features (to find match for local-neighbour)
     *         it was checking only difference between current and previous @p metric and choosen
     *         to match first global-neighour for which this difference was positive (i.e. current
     *         global-neighbour was first 'worse' match for the local-neighbour than the last match)
     * 
     *       4) single global-point-neighbour could not be matched with many local-point-neighbours
     *          ( at least that was probable intention; @bug due to the (probable) bug in code most of 
     *          local-point neighbours has been very often simultaneously matched to the neighbour
     *          associated with the last feature in the global-neighbours-feaures list )
     * 
     *       4) If the local-map point could not be matched with the global-map point it has been removed
     *          from the matching set and the matching process for the whole map (including recalculation
     *          of vectors of features) has been restarted
     * 
     *    These properties of the original algorithm seem to be either result of code bugs or an arbitrary
     *    choice of the maching method that 'it will be working in some way, in the end'. This is justtified
     *    in the perspective of the fact that this matching algorithm has been used as a fall-back for the
     *    previous-transform-based ( @ref match_markers_with_previous_transform ) algorithm and was not used
     *    most of the time.
