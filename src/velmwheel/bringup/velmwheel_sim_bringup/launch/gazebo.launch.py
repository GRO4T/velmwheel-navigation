# @brief      Launchfile running WUT Velmwheel simulation in the Gazebo simulator along with the robot state and joints publishers
# @details 
#    
#    Launchfile running WUT Velmwheel simulation in the Gazebo simulator. User may choose between URDF- and SDF-based 
#    description of the robot. At the moment the SDF-based description is not recommended. Due to lack of parametrized includes 
#    in libsdformat9 there is no way for parametrizing submodels of robot's LIDAR sensors resulting in both LIDAR pluging publishing
#    sensorical data to the same topic.
# 
#    The temporary solution could be to provide separated, boilerplate definitions for both sensors but it would an ugly solution). 
#    Instead, Velmwheel simulation has been switched to the URDF description. This one has an advantage of being the native format
#    for the `rviz2`. Unfortunately, the Gazbo-built-in URDF-SDF converter arrives with some bugd in Gazebo-11 that make produced
#    modols looking bad (depending on the setup either in the `rviz` or `gazebo`). To solve this problem, the underlying launch 
#    provides a simple rgex-based fine-tunning mechanisms that fies some major issues with the robot's description published
#    on the '/robot_description' topic. Such a modified version of the URDF files is then passed to the '/spawn_entity' service
#    as a base for genereting the SDF description for Gazebo. This mechanism introduces very limited complexity into the project 
#    and provides a highly interface for using native robot description formats in both `rviz` and `gazebo`.
